### This is a collection of some interesting repos that I've found useful during my projects

- [PapaParse](https://github.com/mholt/PapaParse) - Fast and powerful CSV (delimited text) parser that gracefully handles large files and malformed input
- [NodeMailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) - Send e-mails with Node.JS â€“ easy as cake!
